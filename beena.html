	  <h3> overviw</u> </h3>
	  <h4> Basically, what I have is the Sega Toys 2005 console "Advanced Pico Beena". Yeah, yeah, the one what Is hard to find. <br>
	  So, what I did is got the console, and got Taiko no Tatsujin Ongaku Lesson. here are some things.

	  </div><br>
	  I got this console on some day in late 2021. It was like a life to me. But only just a year later; I have now put <br>
	  Songs into the computer file. So have a look at everything! (Ongaku Lesson Songs are <a href="songs.html">here.</a>)<br>
	  There is a young, fun gallery underneath all of these texts and also the image "Thank you".png. (!) <br>
	  Also the ripped songs from Taiko no Tatsujin: Ongaku Lesson are <a href="songs.html"> here... </a>

	  <h4> Sometime in very early 2022 (I believe around Januart 2nd) I was browsing the top auction service, Yahoo Auctions (Japan Versuib). <br>
	  Scrolling through the many pages, all I saw was the same-old-same-old. Nintendo Switch game, Wii Game, Ps2 Game lest<br>
	  for a couple of Soundtrack CDs and maybe irrelevant Arcade items. This was when it struck me; seeing the beauty of the <br>
	  Advanced pico beena, WITH Taiko no Tatsujin Ongaku Lesson?! I had to get it. So, I had set multiple alarms on my phone <br>
	  for that day, 2 hours before - 10:30, 1 hour before - 11: 30, 30 Minutes before - 12. I always leave my latest at 30 minutes <br>
	  before, then set manual timers after that. 10 minute timer (no action on auction? nice. 20 minutes left.). Another 10 minute <br>
	  timer (STILL no action on auction? Wow. 10 minutes left.) At this point, I monitor the auction religiously - 3 tabs on <br>
	  my screen - Zenmarket, Buyee and Yahoo Japan. Refreshing every 30 seconds. The timer ticking down. Once the timer ticks to 6 <br>
	  minutes left, I spring into action. "Place a Bid", Zenmarket's beautiful user interface tells me. I check, am I logged in? Yes.<br>
	  I put in my amount. Since nobody's bidden yet... 2000 yen (minimum amount.). The bid goes through. <br>I am the leading bidder. <br>
	  Then, another 5 minutes to go. Anxiously waiting. But nobody bids. "Huh?!" I think to myself. This kind of stuff's shown <br>
	  up just once ever on here in over 2 years of looking, and nobody's bidden on it?! I check all 3 tabs yet again. 1 Bidder - Me. <br>
	  The timer ticks down - 10 seconds left.... 5.... 3... 2.. 1. Then, Zenmarket loads up, and I have won the auction. <br>
	  Back of the net.*

	  <h4> When the Pico Beena arrived, it was like a dream to me.. Boxed and all! I open the box, take out the cables and the pico Beena, <br>
	  and check it out. Since I didn't want to instantly destroy the console, I didn't use the power adapter, instead opting <br>
	  for the handy option of BATTERIES! However, I was met with unfortunateness when I opened the Beena's battery compartment... <br>
	  Aah! Battery Corrosion! <br><br><img src="corrosion.jpg" height=300><br><br>
	  In order to combat this, I consulted wizards and concocted a potion to tame the corrosion, what had plagued these lands, lest badnesses happen... <h6>
	  【I also had to open it or the insides would be wettened】

	  These are pictures above of what the inside of the pico beena looks like and stuff..<br>
	  After this, the Pico Beena started up and worked fine! It was beautiful. After showing this off to everybody what I knew, <br>
	  I knew what was necessary for me to do. I had to get the songs preserved! </h4>
	  <h2> <u>Presreveration... </h2>
	  <h3> on a starry night...</u> </h3>
	  <h4>Basically, whiles back, I had bought an RCA capture card, but never got round to actually using it. Included with the card <br>
	  was a tiny little disc which had on it the software that the capture card used, but it never actually installed the software, so <br>
	  I just gave up. It wasn't really going to come into use anyway.. Until now. So, I unearthed the Capture Card, installed the software, <br>
	  (after making promises to Taiko Discord Group that they would recieve extensive footage of every song)... and then realised that; alas;:<br>
	  The capture card software needed a SECURITY KEY??! Oh dear. The security key was in the manual - which I threw away. Fast forward from Jan 2021 <br>
	  to December 25th 2022 and (coincidentally on crismes) I got caputre card and did what was necessary - get the songs off, and also <br>
	  Multiple people was very happy about this. I pulled 2 all nighters to deliver only the best to my people, and they recieved it very happily... <br>

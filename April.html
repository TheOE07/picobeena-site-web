	  It was the day of the March 31st... I had woken up from my Bed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgUBULj1l34" target="_blank"><img src="bed.png" height=20></a> and went to the institution. <br>
	  There was a large excitement in the air, since I knew what was going to happen. <a href="256love.html">The System 256</a> with <br>
	  Taiko no Tatsujin 9 will arrive this day! As I arrived at home, I saw the box. It was of a substantial size <br>
	  And I opened it. Here are images of stuff... <br>

	  </div>
	  Here are the images of the opening... the system 256 arrived!!!<br>
	  It was also really well packaged - There was loads of foam covering the 256 which isn't really visible in any of <br>
	  these images, but it is there.<br>
	  After the gracious unboxing, I carried the very heavy System 256 up the stairs ultimately carefully, in order not to break it.. <br>
	  Having it situated beautifully on my desk, I felt a feeling of ultimate completion - My life aim is one step closer to completion.<br>

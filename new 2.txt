First off, connect each AD pin with a 10 kΩ resistor connected to AVCC.

AD0 -- 10 kΩ -- AVCC
AD1 -- 10 kΩ -- AVCC
AD2 -- 10 kΩ -- AVCC
AD3 -- 10 kΩ -- AVCC
AD4 -- 10 kΩ -- AVCC
AD5 -- 10 kΩ -- AVCC
AD6 -- 10 kΩ -- AVCC
AD7 -- 10 kΩ -- AVCC
AD8 -- 10 kΩ -- AVCC

This will serve as two purposes.
1) to pull the AD inputs high when not connected to a drum, thus eliminating the random drum hits.
2) to provide a positive reference voltage, but no current, to oppose the drum output which serves as a 2-pole variable resistor to ground.

Now we need to connect the drum inputs- you might have to swap them around to match the pinout of your drum.

Drum 1 output 1 -> AD0
Drum 1 output 2 -> AD1
Drum 1 output 3 -> AD2
Drum 1 output 4 -> AD3

Drum 2 output 1 -> AD4
Drum 2 output 2 -> AD5
Drum 2 output 3 -> AD6
Drum 2 output 4 -> AD7

Then you'll need to connect the grounds from each drum to AGND.

Drum 1 GND 1 -> AGND
Drum 1 GND 2 -> AGND
Drum 1 GND 3 -> AGND
Drum 1 GND 4 -> AGND
Drum 2 GND 1 -> AGND
Drum 2 GND 2 -> AGND
Drum 2 GND 3 -> AGND
Drum 2 GND 4 -> AGND

From here, you can wire up the rest of the digital IO as a service panel (this is the suggested configuration):

COIN (SPST Pushbutton)
TEST (SPST Pushbutton)
SERVICE (SPST Toggle)
UP/DOWN (SPDT Momentary)
ENTER (SPST Pushbutton)

You WILL want to wire up a service panel in order to set the analog thresholds for the drums.

Pretty sure I've explained this all correct... </p>
